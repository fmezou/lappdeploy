 recommended.

       following command in the AppPackage column: 
       addmsi [filename of the msi package]
       Example
        addmsi TortoiseSVN-1.8.8.25755-x64-svn-1.8.5.msi
    2/ copy all the msi packages in the \software\custom directory and fix the 
       msiexec command in the AppPackage column.
       Example
        %SystemRoot%\System32\msiexec.exe /i TortoiseSVN\TortoiseSVN-1.8.8.25755-x64-svn-1.8.5.msi /passive /norestart /log "%SystemRoot%\Temp\TortoiseSVN-1.8.8.25755-x64-svn-1.8.5.log"
